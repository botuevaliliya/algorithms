# ðŸ§  Top 100 LeetCode Algorithms â€“ Python Solutions

This repository contains clear Python solutions to the **Top 100 most frequently asked LeetCode problems**, consolidated into a single file: `leetcode.py`.

Each problem includes the original prompt as a comment, followed by a solution. This collection helped me build strong algorithmic intuition through consistent practice and problem pattern recognition.

After solving the first 100 core LeetCode problems, I further deepened my understanding by completing the **"1010 Algorithms" course by Vlad Ten** â€” which covered algorithmic theory and patterns conceptually and visually.

This combination of practice and theory helped reinforce:
- Pattern recognition
- Conceptual clarity
- Efficient coding under constraints
